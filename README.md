# Analysis of Hendershott, Livdan and Rösch (2020) during Recessionary Periods

Reconstruction of the 2020 paper by Terrence Hendershott, Dmitry Livdana, Dominik Röschb published in the Journal of Financial Economics, 'Asset Pricing: A Tale of Night and Day' during recent recessionary periods.

They showed that while the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) performs poorly empirical when relating market beta to close-to-close returns, the model performs well with close-to-open returns. In fact stock returns are positively related to beta overnight and negatively related during the day.
